          <h3>Interference of the mother tongue in the pronunciation of a second language</h3><br>
          - Excuse me, what did you say? <br>
Has it ever happened to you that sometimes they do not understand what you say when you speak in English? If the answer is yes, it is likely that there is a strong interference of your mother tongue with the pronunciation of the second language. To learn a new language, it is necessary to develop a series of skills that allow the learner to be competent in the second language. Among those skills is the ability to speak.<br>
From this ability, the correct pronunciation of the words of the target language can be deduced. However, when there is a great difference between the phonetic system of the second language with respect to the learner's first language, interference can occur. Is the interference of the mother tongue an obstacle to learning pronunciation? According to Lott (1983), interference can be understood as “the errors that can be traced back to the first language, while the learners use the second language” (p. 146). This could be considered negative aspects during learning a new language, since it drives the learner to change the sounds of the target language. <br>
Likewise, there is another phenomenon called transfer. This occurs when learners use applicable features of their native language to learn another language. That is why it is important to reflect on our learning. We could not leave critical thinking aside when learning a language. Critical thinking allows students to analyze the target language from different perspectives. In this type of thinking, metacognition is involved, since students can reflect on what they have learned and what they need to improve.
          <br><br><br><br>

          <h3>How experts answer the question: <br>
            Why does the mother tongue always interfere with one’s pronunciation?
            </h3><br>

            <h5>Expert 1.</h5><br>
            There is a phenomenon called interlanguage, in which the person who is learning a L2 is part of the knowledge of the L1, especially in people who are no longer infants. So all the prior knowledge they have of L1 is going to have an impact on L2, mainly in phonetic aspects. That is the natural process. When you learn a second language, you start with the knowledge of the L1, so you do not know the pronunciation of the L2 and much of the reading or pronunciation that you have in the L2 will be based on the previous knowledge of the L1.<br>
            

            <br><h5>Expert 2.</h5><br>
            Many times when we are learning a second language, specifically to pronounce, the first language may or may not favor the production of the second language. Certainly, when we come across some words that are pronounced similarly in both English and Spanish, this makes it easier for us to learn the pronunciation of the second. However, when that happens in the opposite way, it starts to be a problem. For example, those words that can be written in a similar way in both Spanish and English, but that can sound different.<br>
            

            <br><h5>Expert 3.</h5><br>
            One of the first things that is quickly noticed is that English is not pronounced exactly as it is written. On the other hand, Spanish is pronounced as it is written, that is, the same graphic way is the way it is pronounced. Therefore, many beginner students, when they are learning English, try to follow the same pattern of pronunciation of the language – in this case Spanish – to pronounce the words in English. I think that this is the first interference that there is, that students systematically seek to pronounce or say the words in the same way as in English. It is true that some are pronounced exactly as they are written, but the vast majority are not pronounced as they are written, those are irregular words.<br><br><br><br>
            
            <h3>The influence of the mother tongue in the second language at a phonological level
              </h3><br>

              When learning a new language, knowledge such as grammar structures and pronunciation patterns tend to be transferred from the mother tongue to the second language. This influence between the mother tongue and the second language is called transfer. However, when there are negative effects that interrupts the correct pronunciation of the L2, that phenomenon is called interference. <br>
              Firstly, it is important to mention that English is not a phonetic language like Spanish. This means that in most cases there is no correlation between the graphic form and the pronunciation of the word (Wall Street English Argentina, 2017, para. 1). Here is one of the main challenges that English learners face. <br>
              It is important to note that there are numerous similarities between Spanish and English. For instance, the same basic sentence structure and word order, except for the placement of adjectives and nouns. In addition, both languages use the Roman alphabet. However, despite these similarities between the two languages, English has almost twice as many phonemes as Spanish. <br>
              In the English alphabet, there are 26 letters, of which 44 different phonemes can be produced (Kelly, 2000, p. 122). While in Spanish, it has 24 phonemes, which come from 5 vowels and 19 consonants. Evidently, Spanish does not have many of these phonemes, so when learning English it is not easy to produce those sounds. <br>
              Native Spanish speakers would have a hard time recognizing the different sounds (phonemes) that a single vowel can produce. Therefore, they will have problems differentiating those sounds when producing them. On the other hand, one of the most common issues is that this differentiation of phonemes is not made. <br>
              According to Singh, to achieve a good pronunciation, the ideal is to start with the familiarization of the phonemes of the target language (2016). In addition, it is important to train our listening skills to get used to (learn to distinguish) the different phonemes that may exist in the language that one seeks to learn.<br><br><br><br>

              <h3>Transfer and interference of phonemes from mother tongue in a L2</h3><br>
              Transfer is a phenomenon in which the learner or speaker of a L2 tends to use the knowledge of their mother language to communicate. This situation could bifurcate into a positive transfer or negative transfer in which the first one is a beneficial situation because the previous knowledge of an L1 can facilitate the transmission of information in the L2. By contrast the negative transfer refers to a complication in competent communication as the learner or speaker tries to adapt their previous knowledge on their L1 to the L2.<br>
              Secondly, interference can be defined as the intervention of the L1 when a learner attempts to communicate in a L2. The habits of the mother tongue, in this case the pronunciation habits, creates in the L2 speaker a shock in which they try to speak following the phonological conventions of their native language.  Kellerman (1977) wrote, ‘Individuals tend to transfer the forms and meanings and the distribution of forms and meanings of their native language to the foreign language”.<br>
              This transfer or interference situation is commonly observed at the beginning of the learning of an L2. Most of the times the teacher can observe the students translating phrases from the L1 to the L2 while making mistakes like confuse the distribution of words in a sentence, misunderstand the meaning of some words or the wrong pronunciation of a huge amount of words.<br>
              These language phenomena are for sure a condition every L2 learner would experience during the process of acquiring a second language but it is a condition that is always present, even in native-like speakers, because the rules of the L1 never disappear and are always interfering the process of communication.<br><br><br><br>

              <br><br>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
              By noticing the effects of the mother tongue on the process of acquiring a L2, the learners can develop better strategies to face this obstacle in order to enhance their communication proficiency. Knowing the transfer phenomena helps the students to create relations between their native language conventions and the phonological rules of the second language, which can be used to facilitate the pronunciation of words known as cognates. Apart of that, learners must be aware of the phonetic rules from the L2 so they can pronounce that language in a proper way.<br><br>

              This research paper carries out a contrastive analysis between the English spoken in the Sylhet district and English (RP) in phonological terms. Arpita Goswami mentions that the mistakes Sylheti Bangla speakers make in speaking English is due to strong interference from their mother tongue. Therefore, the author's objective is to show in which aspects the contemporary teaching of English could be improved to reduce the number of errors in its pronunciation. Despite focusing on comparing the Sylheti Bangla language with English, the author clearly defines the concepts of transfer and interference.<br>
